# TinyFish Tunneling Service (tinyfi.sh)

Creates instant public HTTPS URLs for locally running apps via SSH tunneling. Free, no account, no installation beyond SSH.

## Pre-flight Check (REQUIRED)

Verify SSH is available (it almost always is):

```bash
which ssh && echo "SSH available" || echo "SSH not found — install OpenSSH first"
```

## Quick Start

**Warning:** This exposes your local service to the public internet. Avoid tunneling admin panels, debug endpoints, or services that expose secrets or credentials.

```bash
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new -R 80:localhost:<PORT> tinyfi.sh
```

Replace `<PORT>` with the port your app is running on. The command will print a public `https://<random>.tinyfi.sh` URL.

> **Note:** `StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new` automatically trusts the tinyfi.sh host key on first connection and rejects changes on subsequent connections. This is safe for typical use but if you require stricter verification, you can manually confirm the server fingerprint before first use.

## Custom Subdomain

Request a specific subdomain instead of a random one:

```bash
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new -R myname:80:localhost:<PORT> tinyfi.sh
```

This gives you `https://myname.tinyfi.sh`.

## Keep-Alive (Stable Connections)

For long-running tunnels, add a keep-alive interval to prevent disconnection:

```bash
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new -o ServerAliveInterval=60 -R 80:localhost:<PORT> tinyfi.sh
```

## Usage Guidelines

When starting a tunnel for the user:

1. **Ask which port** to expose if not already specified
2. **Run the SSH command** in the background so the agent can continue working
3. **Report the public URL** back to the user once the tunnel is established
4. The tunnel stays open as long as the SSH connection is alive

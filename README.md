## About This Repository

Welcome to the **TinyFish Cookbook!** This is a growing collection of recipes, demos, and automations built with TinyFish.

**🏆 We're SOTA!** — we just scored 90% on Mind2Web benchmark, outperforming Gemini by 21 points, OpenAI by 29, and Anthropic by 34. We ran all 300 tasks in parallel and published every single run publicly. [Read our benchmark results →](https://tinyfish.ai/blog/mind2web) | [View all runs →](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jgRESVlSYygPO4dKKqzPohGUX5b78Ay59422mM29CsU/edit?gid=436688783#gid=436688783)

## What is TinyFish?

**SOTA web agents in an API** that lets you treat real websites like programmable surfaces. Instead of juggling headless browsers, selectors, proxies, and weird edge cases, you call a single API with a goal and some URLs and get back clean JSON. It handles navigation, forms, filters, dynamic content, proxies, and multi-step flows across many sites at once.

The same infrastructure and agents used by big enterprises (like Google, Doordash and Classpass), now for everyone!


## Why TinyFish?
- 🕸️ **Fully managed browser and agent infra in one API**
- 🌐 **Any website → API** — Turn sites without APIs into programmable data sources
- 💬 **Natural language goals** — Send a URL + plain English, get structured JSON back
- 🤖 **Real browser automation** — Multi-step flows, forms, filters, calendars, dynamic content
- 🥷 **Built-in stealth mode** — Rotating proxies + stealth profiles included (no extra cost)
- 📊 **Production-grade logs** — Full observability and debugging for every run
- 🔌 **Flexible integration** — HTTP API, visual Playground, or MCP server for Claude/Cursor

## Getting Started with the API

You don't need to install heavy SDKs. TinyFish works with standard HTTP requests.

### 1. Get your API Key

Sign up on [tinyfish.ai](https://tinyfish.ai) and grab your API key.

### 2. Run a Command

Here is how to run a simple automation agent:

#### cURL

```bash
curl -N -X POST https://agent.tinyfish.ai/v1/automation/run-sse \
  -H "X-API-Key: $TINYFISH_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://agentql.com",
    "goal": "Find all AgentQL subscription plans and their prices. Return result in json format"
  }'
```

#### Python

```python
import json
import os
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://agent.tinyfish.ai/v1/automation/run-sse",
    headers={
        "X-API-Key": os.getenv("TINYFISH_API_KEY"),
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    json={
        "url": "https://agentql.com",
        "goal": "Find all AgentQL subscription plans and their prices. Return result in json format",
    },
    stream=True,
)

for line in response.iter_lines():
    if line:
        line_str = line.decode("utf-8")
        if line_str.startswith("data: "):
            event = json.loads(line_str[6:])
            print(event)
```

#### TypeScript

```typescript
const response = await fetch("https://agent.tinyfish.ai/v1/automation/run-sse", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "X-API-Key": process.env.TINYFISH_API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    url: "https://agentql.com",
    goal: "Find all AgentQL subscription plans and their prices. Return result in json format",
  }),
});

const reader = response.body.getReader();
const decoder = new TextDecoder();

while (true) {
  const { done, value } = await reader.read();
  if (done) break;
  console.log(decoder.decode(value));
}
```

> By the way! If you want to expose your project on localhost to your friends to show them a demo, you can now use the [tinyfi.sh](https://tinyfi.sh) by us! Completely free and easy to use!
